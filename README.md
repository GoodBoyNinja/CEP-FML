How to create an After-Effects extensions without losing your mind

## Intro
I have just finished writing my first Extension from Adobe After-Effects. Saying that the proccess was rough is an understatement. I am writing this in hope to **define the path from start to finish** to hopefully help someone out there to create their own extensions.

## My experience
I started learning how to code because I wanted to learn expressions in After-Effects. Not long after I started learning scripting, extendscript, and finally extensions. My point of view is of a person who does not come from a web dev background.
